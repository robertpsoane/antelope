The level coded is dependent on how the idea is developed or refined and the degree of observable engagement, particularly from the patient. The refinement of ideas may stray into what seems like a PCD theme, as the barriers to actions are discussed. This should be coded as PCD and return to API if further action planning is restarted. If the rationale for a particular action is given but no explicit suggestion is made that it could be done then this should be coded as IDI. For actions that are planned to be completed in the transcript use the STF theme.",

Higher ratings demonstrate patient engagement with, and development of therapist information. Lower ratings demonstrate reluctance to engage with, or active rejection of therapist information. If information is provided by a therapist in the middle of a turn, but the patient does not directly respond to the information given then the relevant section of the therapist turn is coded as IDI, 0. This is differentiated from PAU because any information given is theoretical, abstract or general, as opposed to a personalised conceptualisation or explanation of a situation (see example 1). Key to this is the use of pronouns. Information using “we/you plural, “people” etc. would be coded as IDI. Whereas information using personal pronouns (you singular) would be coded as PAU. Segments coded as IDI contain information which could be delivered to an audience of several people and would not make sense if it was not delivered to the individual.",

Higher ratings demonstrate new patient understandings, even if initiated by the therapist, that logically feed into interventions. Lower ratings demonstrate either clearly counterproductive understandings or oppositional responses to presentations of new understandings. Interactions would move from PCD ratings when questioning or descriptive interactions move to explanatory interactions. PAU is differentiated from IDI because any information given is personalised to the individual within a specific context, conceptualising an explanation of a situation.",

The level coded depends upon the degree to which the patient notices, develops and personally owns positive or negative changes.

This theme is also coded when working through a structured task and clear instructions are being given and followed – in this case as few as one following turn can be coded. The theme includes changes of direction initiated by drifting or deviating from a specified topic. This may be coded alongside another theme relevant to the content of the change in direction. It includes agenda mapping that may occur at the beginning and throughout the transcript. Higher ratings demonstrate maintenance of a strong focus on relevant topics, endorsed, followed and/or developed by both parties. Lower ratings demonstrate unaddressed changes in focus, moving away from or seeming to avoid relevant topics; if maintained (i.e. not corrected within two turns of speech) these passages are negatively coded for the duration of the deviation regardless of number of turns. A positive code is applied if a party draws the conversation back onto relevant topics after a deviation and this is maintained.",
